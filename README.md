- Define route handlers to perform CRUD operations:
  - **Create Article:** Save a new article to the database.
  - **Edit Article:** Update an article's title and content in the database.
  - **Delete Article:** Remove an article from the database.
- Set up the server to listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000) for incoming requests.

## 2. Views (`views/`):
- Create EJS templates for various pages, including `home.ejs`, `article.ejs`, `compose.ejs`, `edit.ejs`, `about.ejs`, and `contact.ejs`.
- Utilize EJS syntax to render dynamic content, such as article titles, content, and form inputs.
- Include EJS partials for the header and footer sections to maintain consistent styling across pages.

## 3. Static Assets (`public/`):
- Store static files like CSS stylesheets, images, and client-side JavaScript scripts.
- Link these files in the EJS templates to apply styling and interactivity to the website.

## 4. Mongoose Models (`models/`):
- Define the Mongoose schema for the `Article` model.
- The schema specifies the structure of an article, including fields like `title` and `content`.

## 5. Functionality Flow:
- When a user accesses the home page, the server fetches a list of articles from the database and renders them using the `home.ejs` template.
- Clicking on an article title leads to the display of the full article content using the `article.ejs` template.
- The "Compose" link takes the user to the form on the `compose.ejs` page, where they can create a new article.
- Editing an article allows users to modify its title and content using the `edit.ejs` template.
- Deleting an article removes it from the database and redirects the user back to the home page.
- The "About" and "Contact" pages provide information about the website and a way to contact the creators.

## Mongoose Functions Explanation

1. **Setting Up Mongoose Connection (`mongoose.connect()`)**:
   - This function establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using the provided connection URL.
   - It enables the application to interact with the database using Mongoose models.

2. **Creating a Mongoose Model (`const Article = mongoose.model('Article', articleSchema)`)**:
   - Defines a model named "Article" with the specified schema (`articleSchema`).
   - Allows the application to create, read, update, and delete articles in the database.

3. **Creating a New Article (`const article = new Article({ title, content })`)**:
   - Creates a new instance of the Article model with provided title and content.
   - Represents a new article that can be saved to the database.

4. **Saving an Article (`article.save()`)**:
   - Saves the newly created article instance to the MongoDB database.
   - Once saved, the article becomes persistent and can be retrieved later.

5. **Querying for Articles (`Article.find()`, `Article.findOne()`, `Article.findById()`)**:
   - `Article.find()`: Retrieves an array of all articles from the database.
   - `Article.findOne()`: Retrieves a single article that matches the specified criteria.
   - `Article.findById()`: Retrieves an article based on its unique ID.

6. **Updating an Article (`Article.updateOne()`, `Article.findByIdAndUpdate()`)**:
   - `Article.updateOne()`: Updates one or more articles that match the specified criteria with new data.
   - `Article.findByIdAndUpdate()`: Finds an article by ID and updates its content.

7. **Deleting an Article (`Article.deleteOne()`, `Article.findByIdAndRemove()`)**:
   - `Article.deleteOne()`: Deletes a single article that matches the specified criteria.
   - `Article.findByIdAndRemove()`: Finds an article by ID and removes it from the database.

8. **Using Promises and Callbacks**:
   - Mongoose functions support both promises and callbacks for handling asynchronous operations.
   - Promises allow you to use `.then()` and `.catch()` for handling success and errors.
   - Callbacks can be used to define custom behavior after the operation completes.

9. **Mongoose Middleware (`articleSchema.pre()`)**:
   - Middleware functions are executed before or after specific actions, such as saving or removing a document.
   - In the project, middleware could be used for tasks like validating data before saving.
